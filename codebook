The variables for tidy_Data come from file features.txt. 

There were some changes IÂ´ve done to make them readable from original, that is described at run_analysis.R

Variable Subject corresponds to the number of subjet sampled.

Variable Activity corresponds to one of the differents positions: 
WALKING WALKING_UPSTAIRS  WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS SITTING STANDING  LAYING

Variables with string "angle" in its name are measured in radians/second. 

The rest of the variables are the acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer which are 
measured in standard gravity units 'g' in its corresponding axis.
